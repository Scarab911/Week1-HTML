        <p>
            The Magic of Thinking Big gives you useful methods, not
            empty
            promises. Dr. Schwartz presents a carefully designed
            program for
            getting the most out of your job, your marriage and family
            life, and
            your community. He proves that you don’t need to be an
            intellectual or
            have innate talent to attain great success and
            satisfaction—but you do
            need to learn and understand the habit of thinking and
            behaving in
            ways that will get you there. This book gives you those
            secrets!
