            Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two
            dads — his
            real father and the father of his best friend, his rich
            dad — and the
            ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and
            investing.
            The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high
            income to be
            rich and explains the difference between working for money
            and having
            your money work for you.
