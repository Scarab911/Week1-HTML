            League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League,
            is a 2009
            multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and
            published by
            Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom
            map for
            Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a
            stand-alone game in
            the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League
            has been
            free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable
            character
            customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows
            and macOS.
